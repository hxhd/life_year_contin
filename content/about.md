This series of blog is aiming at finding the effect of time on the life expectancy in different continents. The data used is provided by organisation  [gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org).

In first blog, we visualized the relationship between time and life expectancy, in th second one, we test the effect statistically using linear regression model, from the result, we got idea that the life expectancy should also be affected by location, hence ,we in the third blog, we include continents and its interaction with time in a regression model, the result confirmed our assumption.
